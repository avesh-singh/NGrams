last by awarding to the claimants the sum of $119742218 leaving a balance of $753782 which was distributed ratably amongst all the claimants to whom awards had been made according to the directions of the act </s> </p> <p> <s>the exhibits appended to the report from the commissioner of the general land office present the actual condition of that common property of the union </s> <s> the amount paid into the treasury from the proceeds of lands during the year 1827 and for the first half of 1828 falls little short of $2000000 </s> <s> the propriety of further extending the time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the united states by the purchasers of the public lands limited by the act of march 21st 1828 to july 4th 1829 will claim the consideration of congress to whose vigilance and careful attention the regulation disposal and preservation of this great national inheritance has by the people of the united states been intrusted </s> </p> <p> <s>among the important subjects to which the attention of the present congress has already been invited and which may occupy their further and deliberate discussion will be the provision to be made for taking the 5th census of enumeration of the inhabitants of the united states </s> <s> the constitution of the united states requires that this enumeration should be made within every term of ten years and the date from which the last enumeration commenced was the first monday of august of the year 1820 </s> </p> <p> <s>the laws under which the former enumerations were taken were enacted at the session of congress immediately preceding the operation but considerable inconveniences were experienced from the delay of legislation to so late a period </s> <s> that law like those of the preceding enumerations directed that the census should be taken by the marshals of the several districts and territories of the union under instructions from the secretary of state </s> <s> the preparation and transmission to the marshals of those instructions required more time than was then allowed between the passage of the law and the day when the enumeration was to commence </s> <s> the term of six months limited for the returns of the marshals was also found even then too short and must be more so now when an additional population of at least 3000000 must be presented upon the returns </s> </p> <p> <s>as they are to be made at the short session of congress it would as well as from other considerations be more convenient to commence the enumeration from an earlier period of the year than the first of august </s> <s> the most favorable season would be the spring </s> </p> <p> <s>on a review of the former enumerations it will be found that the plan for taking every census has contained many improvements upon that of its predecessor </s> <s> the last is still susceptible of much improvement </s> <s> the 3rd census was the first at which any account was taken of the manufactures of the country </s> <s> it was repeated at the last enumeration but the returns in both cases were necessarily very imperfect </s> <s> they must always be so resting of course only upon the communications voluntarily made by individuals interested in some of the manufacturing establishments </s> <s> yet they contained much valuable information and may by some supplementary provision of the law be rendered more effective </s> </p> <p> <s>the columns of age commencing from infancy have hitherto been confined to a few periods all under the number of 45 years </s> <s> important knowledge would be obtained by extending these columns in intervals of ten years to the utmost boundaries of human life </s> <s> the labor of taking them would be a trifling addition to that already prescribed and the result would exhibit comparative tables of longevity highly interesting to the country </s> <s> i deem it my duty further to observe that much of the imperfections in the returns of the last and perhaps of preceding enumerations proceeded from the inadequateness of the compensations allowed to the marshals and their assistants in taking them </s> </p> <p> <s>in closing this communication it only remains for me to assure the legislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of measures recommended by me heretofore and yet to be acted on by them and of the cordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which may receive their sanction during the session tending to the general welfare </s> </p> <p> john quincy adams </p </s> </p> <p>   </p>
